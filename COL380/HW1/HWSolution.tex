\begin{enumerate}
\item %Problem 1:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In an un-pipelined processor, 1000 operations are processed and for each line, a total time of $2ns + 1ns + 1ns + 1ns + 1ns + 1ns + 2ns$ is required. \\
				$\implies$ Total time needed = $1000 * 9ns$ \\
				$\implies$ t = $9000ns$
		\item In the given timings, the first and last stages take $2ns$ the amount of time while the other states take $1ns$ time. Because of this the time spent per instruction is $2ns$.\\
			The number of stages in the pipeline are $7$. \\
			As there are 2 pipelined procesoors, the number of lines executed by each will be half of earlier $ =500$. \\
			$\implies$ Time taken for processing 500 lines by a processor = $500*2ns$ = $ 1000ns$. \\
			But we have not taken into account the time which the last instruction will spend before leaving the pipeline. This is going to be $1ns+1ns+1ns+1ns+1ns+2ns$ = $7ns$. \\
			\vspace{0.1in}
			$\implies$ Total time taken = $1000ns+7ns = 1007ns$.

\item %Problem 2:
	\begin{itemize}
			\item For the peak operation, the entire y will be present in the cache and blocks of x will keep entering and getting evicted by the cache. The present z which is being needed will also be a member of the cache.\\
				Lets now consider the memory access times as follows\\
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Time needed to get the entire y in cache from DRAM: \\
							$K$ amount of cache lines to be retreived = $K*100ns$ time. 
					\item Time needed to get the entire z in cache once from DRAM: \\
							$K$ amount of cache lines to be retreived = $K*100ns$ time. 
					\item Time needed to get the entire x in cache repeatedly from DRAM: \\
							$16K^2/4$ number of cache lines to be retreived = $4K^2*100ns$ \\
					\item Time needed for retreiving data from the caches for the arithmetic operations: \\
							$16K^2$ opearations taking place and for each of these 3 elements have to be accessed from the cache = $ 48K^2$ns\\
					\item Time needed for processing:\\
							$2*16K^2$ operations require a time of = $32K^2 ns$. 
				\end{enumerate}
				$\implies$ Total time for this = $480K^2 + 200K ns$ \\
				Total number of instructions taking place = $32*K^2$.\\
				$\implies$ Number of operations per second = \[ 
						\frac{32 K^2 *10^9}{480K^2 + 200K} \\
				\]
				Approximating K to 1000, $\implies$  \[
						\frac{32 * 10^6 *10^3}{480* 10^6 + 200*10^3} Mflops \\
				\]
				$\implies$ \[
						66.68 Mflops
					\]

		\item Consider the following code for multiplying the matrices \\
				\lstinputlisting[language=C]{MatMul.c}
				For multiplying 2 dense matrices in given, we have to perform $(4K)^3$ mathematical operations \\
				When the matrices are stored in row major form, for matrix $A$, we need to keep a given row $i$ of the matrix $A$ in the cache along with the memory in $C$ where the result is to be stored.
				The elements of matrix $B$ are to be fetched column wise but if we wish to access a particular element, we will get 3 other elements which are of no use at that time.
				Hence for a given $i$ and $j$, the entire column from matrix $C$ needs to be accessed from the DRAM. \\
				Let us calculate the memory access times as follows: \\
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Time spent in getting Matrix $A$ in the cache from DRAM: \\
							$4K^2$ number of cache lines to be retrieved = $4K^2 * 100ns$ time.
					\item Time spent in getting Matrix $C$ in the cache from DRAM: \\
							$4K^2$ number of cache lines to be retrieved = $4K^2 * 100ns$ time.
					\item Time spent in getting Matrix $B$ in the cache from DRAM: \\
							$(4K)^3$ number of cache lines to be retrieved = $64K^3 * 100ns$ time.
					\item Time needed for retreiving data from caches for arithmetic operations: \\
							$3*(4K)^3$ values need to be accessed from the cache = $192K^3$ ns time. \\
					\item Time needed for the arithmetic operations to take place: \\
							$2*(4K)^3$ number of arithmetic operations take place = $128K^3$ ns time.
				\end{enumerate}
				$\implies$ Total time for this = $6720K^3 + 800K^2$ ns. \\
				Total number of instructions taking place = $128K^3$ \\
				$\implies$ Number of operations per second= \\
				\[
					\frac{128*K^3 * 10^9}{6720*K^3 + 800*K^2} Flops
				\]
				Approximating K to 1000 $\implies$
				\[
						\frac{128*10^9*10^3}{6720*10^9 + 800*10^6} MFlops
				\]
				$\implies$  \[
					19.045 Mflops
				\]
\end{itemize}
\item %Problem 3:
	\begin{itemize}
			\item The value assigned to \textit{y} is 1. This is because when the instruction is executed on $T_0$, the value of y is set to 1 and cache 2, snoops the change.
			\item In the case when directory based cache coherence, the value is again 1. As x is in the shared section, when it gets updated by $T_0$ the changes are reflected.
			\item There is no problem based on cache protocols and coherence in this situation. The problem here is because of a race condition.

\item %Problem 4:

%\item % Problem 1: 

%Prove that:
%% starts math environment, multiline
%\[
%1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
%\]

%Using Proof by Induction.

%First, prove that for some n, this equation holds true.

%% starts math environment with alignment on a particular pivot.  The pivot is
%% denoted by '&' on each line
%\begin{align*}
%n = 2
%1^2 + 2^2 & = \frac{2(2+1)(4+1)}{6} \\
%2 + 4 & = \frac{2(3)(5)}{6} \\
%6 &= \frac{30}{6} \\
%6 &= 6
%\end{align*}

%Now, prove that this works for any n+1.

%\begin{align*}
%1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 & = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \\
%1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 + (n+1)^ 2 & = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)}{6} \\
%\intertext{Notice that the n+1 equation contains the n equation.}
%\boxed{1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 } + (n+1)^ 2 & = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)}{6} \\
%\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + (n+1)^2 & = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)}{6} \\
%n(n+1)(2n+1) + 6(n+1)^2 & = (n+1)(n+2)(2n+3) \\
%n(2n+1) + 6(n+1) & = (n+2)(2n+3) \\
%2n^2 + n + 6n + 6 & = 2n^2 + 4n + 3n + 6 \\
%2n^2 + 7n + 6 &= 2n^2 + 7n + 6 \\
%\intertext{therefore}
%1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 & = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
%\end{align*}

%\item % Problem 2
%Prove that

%\[
%6 \mid n^3 - n
%\]

%Using Proof by Induction.

%First prove that this equation is valid for an arbitrary n.

%\begin{align*}
%n & = 2 \\
%6 & \mid 2^3 - 2 \\
%6 & \mid 6
%\end{align*}

%Now, prove for any n+1

%\begin{align*}
%6 & \mid (n+1)^3 - (n+1) \\
%6 & \mid n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 - n - 1 \\
%6 & \mid n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n - n \\
%\intertext{I can pull the original equation out of this one}
%6 & \mid \boxed{n^3 - n} + 3n^2 + 3n \\
%\intertext{Now I need to prove that $3n^2 + 3n$ is divisible by 6}
%6 & \mid 3n^2 + 3n \\
%6 & \mid 3(n^2 + n) \\
%2 & \mid n^2 + n \\ 
%\end{align*}
%% this line contains a snippet of math.  Rather than owning its own line, this 
%% math equation is integrated in into the surrounding text.
%Now I need to prove that $n^2 + n$ is divisible by 2, or even 

%Let n be even. By our proof in class today (seen in one form in problem 3),
%$n^2$ is even when $n$ is even.  An even number added to an even number is even.

%Let n be odd. By the same proof, $n^2$ is odd when $n$ is odd. An odd number
%added to an odd number is an even number. Therefore, $n^2 + n$ is an even
%number. 

%Therefore, $6 \mid (n+1)^3 - (n+1)$.

%\item % Problem 3
%Prove that $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is an irrational number

%Assume that $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is a rational number.  If so, then
%\begin{align*}
%\sqrt[3]{2} = \frac{a}{b} & != 0 \\
%\intertext{\em{where a,b have no common factors}}
%% this command embeds normal text in a math context.  Very useful.
%a^3 & = b\sqrt[3]{2} \\
%a^3 & = 2b^3 
%\intertext{We now know that $a^3$ is even. It would be helpful is a was even.}
%\intertext{Let $a^3$ be even, prove that a is even}
%a^3 & = 2k \\
%a & = \sqrt[3]{2k} \\
%a & = \sqrt[3]{2} \sqrt[3]{k} \\
%\intertext{Blech...lets try again with the contrapositive.}
%% and here I'm embedding normal text with a math snippet in it.
%\intertext{Assume that a is odd, prove $a^3$ is odd.}
%a & = 2k + 1 \\
%a^3 & = 8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 1 \\
%a^3 & = 2(4k^3 + 6k^2 + 3k) + 1 \\
%\intertext{$a^3$ is odd, therefore if $a^3$ is even, a is even.  Now back.}
%a^3 & = 2b^3 \\
%(2L)^3 & = 2b^3 \\
%8L^3 & = 2b^3 \\
%4L^3 & = b^3 \\
%2(2L^3) & = b^3 \\
%\intertext{By the same proof as above, $b$ must be even because $b^3$ is even.
%Now, a and b share the common factor of two, therefore, $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is not
%rational, and therefore irrational.}
%\end{align*}
%\item % Problem 4
%Given G(V,E), we know that $\sum_{1}^{n} \mid d_i = 2e$. Prove
%\[
%e \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
%\]

%\begin{align*}
%\intertext{Base case $n=2$, a graph with two vertices has 1 edge.}
%e & = 1 \\
%e & \leq \frac{2(2-1)}{2} \\
%1 & \leq 1 \\
%\intertext{Now prove the $n+1$ option. When the $n+1$ vertice is added, it can
%add up to $n$ edges, one for each of the existing vertices.}
%e + n & \leq \frac{(n+1)n}{2} \\
%e + n & \leq \frac{n^2 + n}{2} \\
%e + n & \leq \frac{n^2 + n + n - n}{2} \\
%e + n & \leq \frac{n^2 - n}{2} + \frac{2n}{2} \\
%e + n & \leq \boxed{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} + n \\
%\intertext{Therefore, by induction:}
%e & \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
%\end{align*}

%\item % Problem 5

%Show that every graph with two or more nodes contains two nodes that have equal
%degrees.

%Let us try to prove that every graph with two or more nodes have unique
%degrees.  We know that the set of possible degrees for a graph with $n$ vertices
%is:

%\[
%0,1,\ldots,n-1
%\]

%This gives us a total of $n$ unique degrees to assign to our $n$ vertices. We
%must assign a degree of zero to one vertex. A vertex with degree zero is
%connected to no other vertices.  Let us now assign the degree $n-1$ to a
%vertice.  This vertice is connected to every other vertice in the graph.
%This is a contradiction, because it is impossible to simulatenously have a
%vertice that is connected to every other vertice, and a vertice that is
%connected to none.  Therefore, there are at least two vertices with the same
%degree in any graph with at least 2 vertices.
